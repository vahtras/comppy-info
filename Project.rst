Project
=======

The main idea of the project is that you work on something that is useful in
your own research project. In that way you may focus on some of the aspects of
Python so that you leave the course with skills that are relevant for your
daily work. 

The final examination consists of small written project report and a short oral presentation (max 10min). The time for the final presentation will be defined later, but there will be several slots you can sign up to. If you live outside the Stockholm area the presentation can be done remotely (Google hangout).
