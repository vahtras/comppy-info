Preparation
===========

Preparation:

You are expected to bring you own laptop installed with a working installation
of Python and with the most common scientific libraries. You can use the
package manager of your own computer platform, but the easiest solution which
works across all platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux) and which gives all you need for the course is to install the Anaconda distribution: https://www.continuum.io/downloads

For details about installing on a particular platform
https://realpython.com/installing-python/ is a good resource.


Define a small programming project of your choice. It is best if it is something useful in your own research. You will have time to start working on it during the week here.
