Preparation
===========

Preparation:

You are expected to bring you own laptop installed with a working installation of Python and with the most common scientific libraries numpy and scipy. See http://www.scipy.org/install.html for the most common platforms. 

Define a small programming project of your choice. It is best if it is something useful in your own research. You will have time to start working on it during the week here.
