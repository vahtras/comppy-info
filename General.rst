General information
===================

Welcome to the course Computational Python 2020.

This course was originally a PhD course at KTH for graduate students in various
computational sciences with similar programming needs.  It was part of the KCSE
(KTH Computational Science and Engineering Center) program.

SeSE (Swedish e-Science Education) has a similar agenda at a national level and this course is now a part of the SeSE curriculum


The SeSE courses consist of three parts: preparations at home, lectures+exercises on site, and project work at home. These parts are meant to take about one week each, in total approximately three weeks full time work which awards you 5 credits.

The lectures and exercises will this year take place over zoom, 19-23 October, 2020.
Zoom links will be sent to registered participants.
